# Marlin 2 for EasyThreeD K7 rev. B (Black and blue) with ET4000+ Board
Working branch to port firmware for EasyThreeD K7 rev. B with ET4000+ Board. 

This branch is a fork of ET4000PLUS-K9 with some minor tweaks that make the firmware work on a K7 refreshed version. Bear in mind that this firmware is not properly tested, and rev. B may have more differences, in comparison with K7, than additional buttons. The following part of README is a continuation of ET4000PLUS-K9's file.

Some peripherals are missing and wifi board connector is used by the front panel buttons. 
See https://github.com/schmttc/EasyThreeD-K7-STM32/issues/10 for details

# Files to Focus On
- src\pins\stm32f1\pins_MKS_ROBIN_LITE.h - Pin definitions, may need to create a new pin map file if there is a clash
- src\feature\easythreed_ui.cpp - Button behavour main code. Will likely need to set some DEFINE blocks for different UI
- src\feature\easythreed_ui.h - C header file
- Configuration.h 
- Configuration_adv.h

# Physical pin connections

EXP1 connector pin numbers are as in `Additional-Files` branch.
all other connectors are numbered looking from the rear and bottom of the printer, left-to-right up-to-down.

EXP1 pins 2, 4, 9 and 10 are not connected to any peripherals.
